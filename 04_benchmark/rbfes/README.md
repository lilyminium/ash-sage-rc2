# RBFE results

RBFE results are generally computed by OpenFE and uploaded to a Google Drive. The data in `data/jacs` contains this data.

The `run-combine-data-with-reference.sh` script combines computed data with experimental data into two single dataframes: one for `output/dG.csv` and one for `output/ddG.csv`.
