# Valence fitting

The subdirectories here handle steps involved with a ForceBalance valence fit, i.e. re-fitting bonds, angles, propers, impropers to QCArchive data (optimizations and torsiondrives).

The expected steps to be run first are:
- downloading QM data in ../01_download-data
- re-fitting vdW terms in ../02_fit-vdw
