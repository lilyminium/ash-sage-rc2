# Labelling data

In order to select a dataset with broad coverage across force field parameters, the data first needs to be labelled with the corresponding parameters.

The scripts here label the data in the `01_curate-data` directory accordingly with force field parameters, and saves them to disk for fast querying.

Each script tends to take ~20 min or so for me.

Unfortunately the saved labels are difficult to upload for size reasons.

Please see `run-label.sh` for example of use. Each script also has a short docstring.
